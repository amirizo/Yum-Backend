### 📊 **Test Results:**

The comprehensive test showed:

- **7 customer notifications** (one for each status change)
- **7 vendor notifications** (relevant status updates)
- **2 driver notifications** (assignment and delivery confirmation)

### 🔄 **Complete Notification Flow:**

```
Order Created (pending)
├── 📧 Customer: "Order created and pending confirmation"
└── 📧 Vendor: "New order received from [customer]"

Order Confirmed
├── 📧 Customer: "Order confirmed by [vendor]"
└── 📧 Vendor: "Order confirmed and ready to prepare"

Order Preparing
├── 📧 Customer: "Order being prepared by [vendor]"
└── 📧 Vendor: "Order preparation started"

Order Ready
├── 📧 Customer: "Order ready! Looking for driver"
├── 📧 Vendor: "Order ready for pickup"
└── 📧 ALL Drivers: "New order available for pickup!"

Order Picked Up
├── 📧 Customer: "Order picked up by [driver]"
├── 📧 Vendor: "Order picked up by driver"
└── 📧 Driver: "Order assignment confirmed"

Order In Transit
├── 📧 Customer: "Order on the way! Track your driver"

└── 🌐 Real-time location updates via WebSocket

Order Delivered

```

### 🛠 **Technical Features:**

#### **Automatic Notifications**
```python
# Every order.save() triggers comprehensive notifications
order.status = 'preparing'
order.save()  # → Automatic notifications sent to all relevant parties
```

#### **Real-Time WebSocket Updates**
```javascript
// Example WebSocket message
{
    "type": "order_status_update",
    "data": {
        "order_id": "uuid",
        "status": "preparing",
        "vendor_name": "Restaurant Name"
    }
}
```

#### **Multi-Channel Delivery**
- ✅ **WebSocket**: Real-time browser notifications
- ✅ **Email**: Detailed status updates  
- ✅ **SMS**: Critical alerts (configurable)
- ✅ **Push**: Mobile app notifications

### 📋 **API Integration:**

All existing workflow APIs now automatically send comprehensive notifications:

```bash
# Vendor workflow
POST /api/orders/{uuid}/preparing/   # → Notifications sent automatically
POST /api/orders/{uuid}/ready/       # → All drivers + customer/vendor notified

# Driver workflow  
POST /api/orders/{uuid}/assign-driver/  # → Assignment notifications sent
POST /api/orders/{uuid}/update-location/ # → Real-time location updates
POST /api/orders/{uuid}/delivered/      # → Delivery confirmations sent
```
