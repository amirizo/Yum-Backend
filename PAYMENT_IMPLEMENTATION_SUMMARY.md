# Payment System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The payment functionality has been successfully moved from the `orders` app to the `payments` app with proper authentication requirements and email service integration.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Requirements
- **Payment Intent Creation**: Changed from `AllowAny` to `IsAuthenticated` only
- **Payment Confirmation**: Changed from `AllowAny` to `IsAuthenticated` only
- **Checkout**: Remains `AllowAny` (for calculation preview only)

### 2. Payment Views Location
- **Moved FROM**: `orders/views.py`
- **Moved TO**: `payments/views.py`
- **Removed**: `create_payment_intent`, `confirm_payment`, and `clickpesa_webhook` from orders app

### 3. New Endpoints

#### Primary Payment Processing Endpoint
```
POST /api/payments/create-order-and-payment/
```
**Purpose**: Creates order from cart and initiates payment in one step
**Authentication**: Required (IsAuthenticated)
**Request Body**:
```json
{
    "vendor_id": 1,
    "delivery_address": {
        "address": "Street Address",
        "latitude": -6.7924,
        "longitude": 39.2083
    },
    "payment_type": "mobile_money|card|cash",
    "phone_number": "255123456789",
    "special_instructions": "Optional"
}
```

#### Existing Endpoints (Now Authenticated)
```
POST /api/payments/create-intent/        # IsAuthenticated only
POST /api/payments/confirm/              # IsAuthenticated only
POST /api/payments/webhook/clickpesa/    # AllowAny (webhook)
```

### 4. Email Service Integration

#### New Email Functions Added to `authentication/services.py`:
- `send_admin_cash_order_notification(order, payment)`: Notifies admins of new cash orders
- Updated `send_payment_success_email()`: Enhanced payment success notifications

#### SMS Service Updates:
- Fixed `send_payment_success_sms()` to be static method
- Proper integration with payment confirmation workflow

### 5. Checkout Workflow

#### Step 1: Preview Checkout (Optional)
```
POST /api/orders/checkout/
```
- Calculates totals and delivery fees
- No authentication required
- Does NOT create order
- Returns preview with totals

#### Step 2: Create Order and Process Payment
```
POST /api/payments/create-order-and-payment/
```
- **Requires authentication**
- Creates order from user's cart
- Initiates payment process
- Clears cart on successful payment initiation
- Sends notifications

#### Step 3: Confirm Payment
```
POST /api/payments/confirm/
```
- **Requires authentication**
- Checks payment status with ClickPesa
- Updates order status if payment successful
- Sends success notifications

### 6. Payment Types Supported

- Provider: ClickPesa integration
- Currency: TZS
- Method: USSD push to customer's phone
- Status: Real-time confirmation via webhook

### 7. Webhook Processing
- Endpoint: `/api/payments/webhook/clickpesa/`
- Handles: payment.success, payment.failed, refund.processed
- Auto-updates: Order status, payment status
- Sends: Customer notifications on success

### 8. Error Handling & Security
- Duplicate payment prevention
- Order validation before payment
- Cart validation and vendor constraints
- Proper authentication checks
- Comprehensive error messages

## Usage Flow for Authenticated Users

1. **Add items to cart**: `/api/orders/cart/add/`
2. **Preview checkout** (optional): `/api/orders/checkout/`
3. **Create order and pay**: `/api/payments/create-order-and-payment/`
4. **Confirm payment**: `/api/payments/confirm/` (if needed)

## Files Modified

### Primary Files:
- `payments/views.py`: Added new payment processing logic
- `payments/urls.py`: Added new endpoint routes
- `orders/views.py`: Removed payment views, updated checkout
- `orders/urls.py`: Removed payment routes
- `authentication/services.py`: Added email/SMS for payments

### Configuration:
- Authentication requirements enforced
- Email templates integrated
- SMS notifications enabled
- Webhook processing maintained

## Testing Endpoints

### Authenticated Endpoints (Require JWT token):
- All payment creation and confirmation endpoints
- Order creation from cart

### Public Endpoints:
- Checkout preview (calculation only)
- Webhook endpoints

This implementation ensures secure payment processing while maintaining the comprehensive e-commerce workflow with proper separation of concerns between the orders and payments applications.
